# bootlegMinesweeper
My name is REDACTED, I can barely code.
This is my attempt at creating the game Minesweeper using the following.
HTML/CSS and Javascript, along with various back-end languages that I do not know yet.
I have about 3 months of experience in Javascript.
Every line of code in this project is licensed under the following:
KEEP YER GRUBBY PAWS OFFA MUH SH!T.
I am planning to learn to program a server and host this project on that server in the future.
I'm also gonna learn to use the game engine Phaser.js so I can do the GitHub Game Off jam in November 2021.
